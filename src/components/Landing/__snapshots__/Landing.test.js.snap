        One simple app could change your outlook on life

      <p>
        We are in some of the most difficult times in modern history. We are living in a pandemic. Our country is more divided than it has ever been in recent years. People are suffering from anxiety and depression at higher levels than ever documented before.

        How does it work?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This app is simple and yet could change someone's life. Daily Gratitude is a place to practice gratitude. A user can sign up and create a profile and then start a gratitude journal. Each day the user can create a new journal entry. When you sign in you can reflect on your journal in the dashboard.
