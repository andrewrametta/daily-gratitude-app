## About this project

2020 was one of the hardest years in recent history. People have been more stressed, worries, anxious, and overwhelmed by all the events that happened. As we start to move on its hard to always have the best outlook on the future. Personally, my parents have experienced less hope and optimism. I wanted to make something that would help them.

Shawn Anchor, a Harvard Researcher and renowned author, found that "Something as simple as writing down three things your are grateful for every day for 21 days in a row significantly increases your level of optimism, and it holds for the next six months."

I wanted to make this as easy and convenient as possible so I created Daily Gratitude.

Daily Gratitude is a gratitude journal web application that uses the Daily Gratitude API. It is fully responsive and can be used on a desktop or mobile. A user can create an account with a username and password and their profile is completely private and protected.

Once you register, you are given a unique bearer token that is stored in your local storage. You are then taken to the user dashboard where you can look at your journal entries that are in order of recency. Finally, you can click on “Add a New Entry” and then taken to the new entry page where you are prompted to write 3 things you are grateful for in the 3 text boxes below.

Our hope is that as you make this a part of your daily routine, you will start to feel more optimism toward your life as you focus on and remind yourself of those things that you are grateful for. Enjoy!
